Hello there, thanks for using this image! You can go ahead and hit the preview button to see all of this with better formatting.

This repo actually uses discussions for handling feature requests from users (These may get moved to an issues once the idea gets accepted and the scope gets defined). You can open up a discussion mentioning the feature as an idea by going to [discussions](https://github.com/mbround18/valheim-docker/discussions) and opening a new discussion then selecting "Ideas" from "Select Category". From there you can give information on the issues you are having and hopefully get helpful feedback from the community! Be sure to sift through the top discussions to make sure that someone else didn't already post asking for the same feature!
